# Checking for .md files in the project

Looking for any temporary or obsolete markdown files that were created during development and can be safely deleted.

Files to check:
- Any documentation files created during OAuth flow updates
- Temporary note files
- Development documentation that's no longer needed

Core documentation files like README.md should be kept.
